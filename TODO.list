Todo list for commutator
- Update communication protocol
  + Do not erase events until reception is confirmed
- Manufacture PCBs
- Validate double activation mode command
- Document construction steps in Wiki
- Add support for doorlock configuration (besides commutator hard-coded channel number)
  + Doorlock shall activate for a few seconds, not stay on
  
Todo for access servers
- Build and validate:
  + commutator logging dump to file (commutator_get_log [name])

- Set up crontab on RPi
  + Decide frequency for each operation
- Robustify radio link by checking the channel and retrying when message is not received as expected
- Document features and usage in Wiki
- Build enclosure
- Document construction steps in Wiki

Todo for management:
- Create management database for access servers, hostnames, passwords, commutators
  + Draft on personal Dropbox
- Make admin tools for operations
  + Configure software and event logs download using SCP
    o WinSCP under Windows
    o ? under Linux
  + Build a collection of Python/batch/bash scripts to perform remote tasks via SSH/SCP
    o commutator status check, enabling and disabling, etc.
    o Update the pi-access-server software from GitHub
    o Any task available on the access server!
  + Build a (PyQt4?) GUI to perform the same tasks
- Document design and implementation on Wiki
