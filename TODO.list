Todo list for doorlock
- Add wiegand to nano code
- Manufacture PCBs
- Add double activation mode command
- Add check status command (instead of auto)
- Document construction steps in Wiki

Todo for access servers
- Build and validate:
  + commutator status check (commutator_check [name])
    o Poke commutator and return status
  + commutator table update (commutator_update [name])
    o Read csv file
    o Send update command to all commutators
  + commutator enabling, disabling and automatic mode setting (commutator_on [name], commutator_off [name], commutator_auto [name])
    o Send enable/disable/auto command to commutator
  + commutator logging dump to file (commutator_get_log [name])
    o Get logged events from all commutators
    o Write events to file (1 file per commutator)
  + commutator_mem_check
  + commutator_mem_clear
- Set up crontab on RPi
  + Decide frequency for each operation
- Robustify radio link by checking the channel and retrying when message is not received as expected
- Document features and usage in Wiki
- Document construction steps in Wiki

Todo for management:
- Create management database for access servers, hostnames, passwords, commutators
  + Draft on personnal Dropbox
- Make admin tools for operations
  + Configure software and event logs download using SCP
    o WinSCP under Windows
    o ? under Linux
  + Build a collection of Python/batch/bash scripts to perform remote tasks via SSH/SCP
    o commutator status check, enabling and disabling, etc.
    o Update the pi-access-server software from GitHub
    o Any task available on the access server!
  + Build a (PyQt4?) GUI to perform the same tasks
- Document design and implementation on Wiki
